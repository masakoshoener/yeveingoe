As a fairly new Bowie enthusiast, there's one thing that I'm a bit hung up about. I've come across various articles, sources, comments, etc. about the treatment of the Spiders during the Ziggy era.

The story typically goes that the Spiders were eventually fired by Bowie because they asked for a raise. :( I was pretty disappoint.

# 85 Mick Ronson/David Bowie - Moonage Daydream solo https://youtu.be/hPDWsLpC7pE I love early David Bowie, but I can honestly say that I've never delved deep into his catalog of music very much beyond his more famous hits.

A non-hit, it was, and still is, a huge favorite amognst Bowie's fans, and I can now see why. It's an amazing song, with obviously an amazing solo by Mick Ronson. The BBC artist page for Mick Ronson.
